This is a [MCVE][1] to demonstrate [gradle/gradle#11466][2].

In order to reproduce this StackOverflowError:

 1. Check-out this project.
 2. Make sure your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` DO NOT contain any
    gradle publish secret
    (you donâ€™t want to publish this dummy plugin by accident)
    (you just need to comment out the line with your secret if you have one).
 3. Run ./gradlew publishPlugins.
